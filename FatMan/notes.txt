  - 200W peak pulse power
  - four redundant units
    * required two to agree below critical altitude
  - mechanical fuze system as backup

* Construction (inside-out):
  - Neutron Initiator ("Urchin")
    * "Urchin" (Polonium-Beryllium) initiator
      - inside two hemispheres of the Plutonium core/pit
    * 9cm, 6.2kg
    * Beryllium and Polonium 210
    * initiator, neutron source
  - Air Gap
    * between Urchin and Core
    * filled with gold foil?
  - Plutonium Core
    * two hemispheres
    * Plutonium-239 96%, Plutonium-240 1%, and Gallium 3%
    * "Pit"?
    * sphere? diameter?
  - Uranium Tamper Plug ("Slug")
    * core/pit inside cylindrical Uranium tamper plug ("slug").
    * plug was held together with Uranium washers and screws that fit smoothly into the domed ends of the plug.
    * cylinder cut through Tamper (& Pusher?)
    * size? where do the screws and washers go (flush with Tamper sphere)
  - Uranium Tamper
    * sphere of Uranium that contains the Slug, which contains the Pu pit/core
      - natural, unenriched Uranium -- Tuballoy (code name/jargon)
    * hold core and resist explosion, and reflect neutrons back into the core for more efficiency, reduces amount of Pu needed
    * size?
  - Boron-10 Plastic Shell
    * between Tamper and Pusher
    * size?
  - Aluminum Pusher
    * Aluminum-Boron alloy
    * absorbs stray neutrons and widens/smooths the implosion pulse
    * two hemispheres? size?
  - Felt Pad
    * between Aluminum Pusher and Comp-B Booster Block
    * size?
  - Fast Explosive Booster Block
    * Composition-B
    * dimensions?
  - Felt Pad
    * between Comp B Booster Block and Baratol Explosive Lens Element
    * size?
  - Slow Explosive Lens Element
    * Baratol
    * possibly cast together with Fast Explosive Lens Element
    * 32x
    * dimensions?
  - Fast Explosive Lens Element
    * possibly cast together with Slow Explosive Lens Element
    * Composition B: 60% RDX, 39% TNT, 1% wax
    * 10cm between EBW and 
    * 32x

    * around Cork liner
    * ~140cm inner diameter
    * dimensions?
  - Air Space
    * between Dural Shell and Steel Ballistic Case
    * dimensions?
  - Steel Ballistic Case
    * dimensions?

  - air gaps between Urchin and Core
    * filled with 0.013mm gold foil (dimpled or flat?)
  - was a Tamper Plug ("Slug") used in the  Nagasaki or just in Trinity device?
    * yes, looks like it opened towards the tail
    * the Plug layed horizontally
  - the Pusher Hemisphere's were oriented front and back
    * there was a raised rib on the front hemisphere that fit into a groove on the back one
    * there are four cups inset around the seam of the hemispheres to keep them together
      - the name suggests that they were shallow cups-shaped that conformed to the outer dimensions of the sphere
      - they are flush and span the seam
  - the Aluminum Pusher had a screw-in trap-door plug on the tail side hemisphere
    * the Slug slid into the Tuballoy (U-238) Tamper Sphere
  - there are seven Duraluminum segments that make up the outer casing sphere
    * the top and bottom (polar) caps bolted onto flanges on the equatorial segments
  - the top of the physics package is oriented towards the tail
    * imagine the entire unit facing nose down
  - it is unclear how the physics package was fastened to the outer casing
  - lens based on 78:47 detonation-speed ratio and 10cm between EBW and Slow Explosive Lens (Baratol)
  - half of the bolts were left out of one of the Trinity casing's flange
  - needed to ensure that the device didn't rotate when dropped
    * avoid damaging fragile equipment

* Exploding-Bridgewire Detonator (EBW)
  - charge up a capacitor with a battery and then discharge it through the wires
  - cylindrical housing with high explosion at the top end
    * Cambrick tubing
  - two wires (radially) connected through the bottom end
  - 1773 EBW detonators used in Fat Man device
    * two "horns" attached to single booster charge
      - detonated 32 explosive lens units
  - fine wire in contact with explosive
  - high-voltage, high-current, low-impedance electrical source (capacitor)
  - need switch to reliably and consistently generate start pulse
    * used thyristors?
  - wire is vaporized in a few microseconds
    * vaporizes in a few microseconds, stddev O(10)nsec
    * blasting caps just heat the wire, this vaporizes the wires
      - function of how quickly the wire heats up
      - subject to change based on minor electrical variations in the wiring
      - takes O(1-10)msec to detonate
  - generates a shock and heat that detonates the high-explosive
  - required heavy cables to supply high-voltage and high-current
    * low impedance/voltage drop
