1.0 out of 5 stars Critical Mass: Absolute Nonsense!
Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2005
After reading Carter Hydrick's highly inaccurate account of how the plutonium bomb functioned, and after reading the outstanding critique by Robert Norris, I feel compelled to make some comments of my own. Using the oft-quoted premise that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, Mr. Hydrick's extraordinary claims are not backed up by a similar degree of evidence. In fact, I had more than a good laugh or two while I was reading his book. Since the comments made by Norris, as General Grove's biographer, more than effectively refuted Hydrick's claims about the use of the German uranium from U-234, I will confine my comments to his claims about the bombs. He makes sweeping conclusions about the bomb's mechanisms based on his faulty analysis of numerous historical documents along with citing excepts from the Harlow Russ book Project Alberta. I knew Russ and conducted both telephone and in-person interviews in addition to receiving numerous long and detailed correspondences from him.

The linchpin of Hydrick's convoluted theories about the bombs involves his claim that the infra-red detonators that came from the U-234 German submarine were used in the implosion device. He describes the "detonator chimneys" that Russ mentioned in his book along with the use of "hypodermics" to vent radiation from the plutonium core and that somehow these were used to "allow the free flow of light waves throughout the device." He continues, "...the new system allowed waves-including infrared waves-to race at the speed of light through the "detonator chimneys" and "hypodermics" to the other infrared fuses to "simultaneously" ignite them all" and these all "...were used to compress the plutonium core at the speed of light and thus creating a very powerful explosion."

This is absolute nonsense and shows a complete lack of even the most basic knowledge of how these weapons functioned, or for that matter, even a rudimentary knowledge of physics itself!

The "detonator chimneys" as Russ described them, were actually nothing other than small lengths of brass tubing that were glued to the outer surface of each explosive lens in the implosion device. Each of the 32 Model 1773 Exploding Bridge Wire (EBW) detonators was then inserted into a chimney since the sole purpose of these were simply to properly align each EBW in the exact center of the outer surface of each lens. The "hypodermics" mentioned by Hydrick had a completely different, and equally benign, purpose. The stainless steel hypodermic tube was carefully inserted through a hole in the outer Dural shell that housed the implosion components and then pushed down far enough in between the lenses and the inner explosive charges so that it touched the so-called "nuclear pit" at the very center of the implosion device. A 0.040 inch diameter manganese wire was then inserted into this hypodermic tube and withdrawn every six hours to check to see if it had acquired any induced radioactivity. If it had acquired any, this meant that the delicate and tiny Polonium-Beryllium initiator ("Urchin") inside the center of the plutonium core had somehow ruptured due to rough handling during the assembly process and was emitting neutrons which would cause the plutonium to pre-detonate resulting in a fizzle, or failure of the implosion process.

Hydrick is correct when he details the numerous and continuing problems with the development of the detonator. Following Groves' prudent guidelines about multiple, redundant programs for just about everything connected with the Manhattan Project, the scientists were developing two completely different designs (EBW and spark-gap) at the same time in hopes that one of them would eventually work properly with the desired degree of simultaneity. While Luis Alvarez was the detonator group leader, the actual day-to-day design and development of the EBW and spark-gap detonators fell to Larry Johnston and Robert Alldredge. Johnston, not Alvarez, holds the patent for the EBW. There were also problems and delays in the design and production of the x-units that set off the detonators. Some of these delays were certainly compounded by the fact that Raytheon, like many of the sub-contractors, was not informed of the top secret nature of the unit so as not to draw undue attention and therefore treated it as a normal, non-rush production wartime component. In fact, the x-units designs were being constantly tweaked and changed by Los Alamos both before and after the Trinity test. This even resulted in a final drop test at Tinian of the revised unit on August 8th, the day before the Fat Man implosion device was dropped on Nagasaki. However, as every other historian even remotely familiar with these weapons will tell you, both the x-units and the EBW detonators worked perfectly on both the Trinity and Nagasaki devices and definitely did not involve in any way the use of any infra-red proximity fuses as postulated by Hydrick.

Mere light waves, even infra-red ones generating simple and extremely weak electromagnetic radiation moving at the speed of light would not have exerted any pressure whatsoever on the plutonium. It was, in fact, the 5,600 volts of electricity generated by the 64 capacitors in the x-unit that caused the bridgewires in the EBW detonators to vaporize. It was the simultaneous explosion of these 32 EBW detonators that started the massive and powerful imploding detonation wave moving at almost 26,000 feet-per-second through the 5,300 pounds of specially shaped high explosives surrounding the nuclear pit that ultimately compressed the plutonium core and caused the nuclear chain reaction.

Hydrick also spends a lot of time discussing the amount of enriched uranium that was used in the Little Boy uranium gun-assembled nuclear device dropped on Hiroshima. The total amount of uranium that was finally used in Little Boy was 64.15 kilograms, which was for all intents and purposes the entire quantity of enriched uranium that had been produced by Oak Ridge in a full year of round-the-clock production starting in July 1944. As Norris pointed out, none of that uranium was used at Hanford in the production of the plutonium used in both Trinity and Nagasaki devices.

I could go on with even more elaborate explanations, but it simply isn't worth the effort. In the end, it is my considered opinion this book is a colossal waste of the reader's time and I would not recommend it. I'd give it a rating of zero stars, but Amazon will not allow lower than one star. This unfortunate book falls into the same fiction category as Peter Vogel's preposterous claims that the tragic 1944 Port Chicago explosion was actually a coldhearted, murderous test by Los Alamos scientists of a uranium hydride nuclear weapon and the similarly far-fetched claims by Robert Wilcox and others, that the Japanese constructed and possibly exploded their own domestically-produced nuclear weapon in the closing days of WWII.

If the author had actually been able to talk to Harlow Russ before he died, Russ would have immediately set him straight about his far-fetched ideas and this book would never have been written

Nuclear weapons use arrays of explosive lenses to change several nearly spherical diverging waves into one spherical converging wave. It then uses converging waves to collapse various shells (tampers, reflectors, pushers, etc.) and finally compresses the fissile material core (pit) to an immediate critical state. These are typically machined from plastic bonded explosives and inert inserts called waveshapers. Waveshapers are often dense foam or plastic, but many other materials are available. Other, mostly older explosive lenses do not include waveshapers, but employ two explosive types with significantly different detonation velocities (VoD) ranging from 5 to 9 km/s. . Using slow and fast explosives again creates a spherical converging detonation wave, compressing the physics package. The original Gadget device used in the Trinity experiment and the Fat Man dropped on Nagasaki used Balatr as the low VoD explosive and Composition B as the high velocity explosive, but other combinations can be used. The illustration on the left represents a cross-section of a segment of a polygonal wedge. Combine the wedges to form a spherical device. The leftmost detonating bridgewire detonator creates a hemispherical detonation wave through a high velocity outer charge. (It's hemispherical because the detonating bridgewire acts as a point detonator.) When the wave is transmitted to a precisely shaped internal explosive, it forms a new spherical wave around the object. The successful functioning of this device depends on the simultaneous initiation of the waves in each segment, the uniformity and precision of the wave velocities, and the accuracy and precision of the shape of the interface between the two explosives. . A series of experiments were conducted in 1944 and 1945 during the Manhattan Project to develop a lens that produced satisfactory implosion. One of the most important tests was a series of RaLa experiments. Initially, 32 "point" assemblies were used (each equipped with a pair of explosive bridgewire detonators). After that, 92 "point" assemblies were tried with the goal of obtaining a smaller assembly with better performance. Finally, successful tests of the Swan nuclear explosive device allowed assembly at two "points". Using an "air lens" system in addition to a molding agent, the Swan is the basis for all U.S. successor designs, whether nuclear or thermonuclear, and features small size, light weight, and exceptional reliability and safety. , was minimal.

  - Urchin Design
    * From JCM (pg 414):
      - 181 Personal communication from Raemer Schreiber to the author dated 1/22/96 (1.9 cm or 0.7" diameter); Visgin, V.P. The Visgin document stated the initiator diameter to be 2.0 cm (0.79"). Robert Christy told the author on 6/16/02, "Everything was made to be a good fit." A source told the author that postwar LANL documents mention a "standard 0.8-inch diameter ball-polonium" initiator. The May 1, 1946 Los Alamos report LA-555 mentions that the thin-walled beryllium neutron source-sphere used inside the Be hemispheres had a 0.830" 0.D. The Monthly Progress Report of the Chemistry and Metallurgical Division, LAMS-352, February 1, 1946, p. 17, mentions that "Molds are being prepared for casting 0.8 inch diameter spheres of various metals, to be used for nuclear measurements." The interior cavity in the Pu hemispheres was about 0.85" in diameter. Since both the Urchin and the Pu core thermally expanded due to the heat generated by their alpha-particle emissions, the slightly smaller 0.8" diameter initiator (according to sources) "fit snugly" inside the Pu core. Current nuclear devices utilize external neutron initiation, which allows the plutonium core to be machined shapes such as a sphere, cylinder, or ovoid. The dimensions specified in the Visgin document for the Urchin initiator are as follows:
        * Radius of the hollow beryllium sphere 1.0 cm (0.39")
        * Radius of the base of the wedge-shaped groove 0.40 cm (0.157")
        * Radius of the top of the wedge-shaped groove 0.609 cm (0.24")
        * Radius of the solid beryllium ball 0.40 cm (0.156")
      However, one source disputed the Visgin description and told the author on 5/ 1 9/08, "The urchin is machined from two beryllium hemispheres. The inside is hollowed out by boring steps of decreasing radius using a series of end-mills. The result is what looks like a 'theater in the round,' with the circular steps cut in each hemisphere. The beryllium is then flash-coated with Po-210 on the steps." Yet another source confirmed to the author in 2015 the Visgin descriptions are accurate.
  - Fat Man Urchin (from JCM footnotes):
    * Core internal cavity diameter (for the initiator/urchin): 0.85"
    * Urchin outer diameter: 0.8"
    * Urchin fits "snugly" into Core after thermal expansion of both
    * Beryllium hemispheres outer diameter: 0.83"
    * "two Beryllium hemispheres"
      - "inside hollowed out by boring steps of decreasing radius using a series of end-mills"
      - "result looks like a 'theater in the round,' with circular steps cut in each hemisphere"
      - "Beryllium is then flash-coated with Po-210 on the steps"
    * source: "I never saw the final design but if it had 'parallel' grooves they must have been like latitudes, the only way they could be machined to be parallel"
  - JCM thinks Fat Man Pu hemispheres were 3.62" in diameter
    * he doesn't think that his includes a 0.0005" (0.0127 mm) layer of nickle
  - Urchin in USSR Copy Device
    * inside out: 
      - solid Beryllium sphere (1 cm), plated with Polonium, and then Gold (0.1 mm)
        * BE sphere radius: 4 mm (diameter=8 mm, 10 mm after thermal expansion?)
      - hollow Beryllium sphere, inner grooves plated with Polonium, and then Gold (0.1 mm)
        * "inner surface are wedge-shaped grooves"
        * "planes of all the grooves are parallel to one another"
    * 15x "wedge-shaped grooves"
      - radius of base of wedge-shaped groove: 4 mm
      - radius of apex of wedge-shaped groove: 6.09 mm

[I think that the USSR guys used a cast Be sphere with grooves and the US used a BE sphere that used different sized/depth end mills.]
