  - +/- 45deg vertical, 30 deg horizontal
  - Tx and Rx in single unit
  - 415MHz, 30MHz IF
  - 200-800 yards
  - 27.5V @ 3.5A
  - 300-450 pps, 400nsec Pulse Width
  - 200W peak pulse power
  - four redundant units
    * required two to agree below critical altitude
  - mechanical  system as backup

* Exploding-Bridgewire Detonator (EBW)
  - charge up a capacitor with a battery and then discharge it through the wires
  - cylindrical housing with high explosion at the top end
    * Cambrick tubing
  - two wires (radially) connected through the bottom end
  - single detonator per outer lens
  - 1773 EBW detonators used in Fat Man device
    * two "horns" attached to single booster charge
      - detonated 32 explosive lens units
      - wanted redundancy due to high failure rates in tests
  - fine wire in contact with explosive
  - high-voltage, high-current, low-impedance electrical source (capacitor)
    * oil-filled, mylar-foil, or ceramic
    * low-inductance, high-capacitance, high-voltage
    * 1uF @ ~5KV, peak currents between 500-1000A
  - can generate high-voltage with Marx generator
  - need switch to reliably and consistently generate start pulse
    * can use: thyristors, spark gap, krytron, etc. as switch
  - wire is vaporized in a few microseconds
    * vaporizes in a few microseconds, stddev O(10)nsec
    * heating rate is so fast that liquid metal can't flow away and so it vaporizes
      - causes resistance to rise as it gets hotter
      - creates an arc in the metal vapor
        * leads to drop in resistance and sharp spike in current
        * creats a shock wave
      - needs >=100A/usec
    * blasting caps just heat the wire, this vaporizes the wires
      - function of how quickly the wire heats up
      - subject to change based on minor electrical variations in the wiring
      - takes O(1-10)msec to detonate
  - only high-current, fast pulse can trigger EBWs
  - generates a shock and heat that detonates the high-explosive
  - required heavy cables to supply high-voltage and high-current
    * low impedance/voltage drop
    * coax
  - typical explosives detonate at 7-8 Km/sec, 7-8 m/msec
    * <=100ns EBW, at most 1mm difference in detonation wave
  - EBWs are highly regulated
  - normal blasting caps are subject to being triggered by stray currents (from RF?)
  - EBW detonators don't use primary explosives
    * e.g., lead azide, which is sensitive to static discharge
  - bridgewire is typically gold or platinum (or an alloy of both)
    * 0.038mm in diameter and typically 1mm long (can be from 0.25mm to 2.5mm)
  - commonly uses PETN with RDX/PBX/tetryl pellet as booster

  - <looks like two wires (one dark and one light) go to each detonator
    * <two banks of 32 on each side -- alternating rows of 8 dark and 8 light coax>
