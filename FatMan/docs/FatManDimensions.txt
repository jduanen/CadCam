      - just a few thous of clearance
      - 2"-3" diameter aluminium Cups, match curvature of sphere
        * pushed into groves and fastened with screws
        * tap both halves (through split)
        * Cups have larger hole than screw head that is tapped
          - for disassembly -- screw in extraction tool
          - screws are not interchangeable
