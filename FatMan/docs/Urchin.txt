Urchin

From JCM (pg 414):
181 Personal communication from Raemer Schreiber to the author dated 1/22/96 (1.9 cm or 0.7" diameter); 
Visgin, V.P. The Visgin document stated the initiator diameter to be 2.0 cm (0.79"). Robert Christy told the
author on 6/16/02, "Everything was made to be a good fit." A source told the author that postwar LANL
documents mention a "standard 0.8-inch diameter ball-polonium" initiator. The May 1, 1946 Los Alamos
report LA-555 mentions that the thin-walled beryllium neutron source-sphere used inside the Be hemispheres
had a 0.830" 0.D. The Monthly Progress Report of the Chemistry and Metallurgical Division, LAMS-352, February 1, 1946, p. 17, mentions that "Molds are being prepared for casting 0.8 inch diameter spheres of
various metals, to be used for nuclear measurements." The interior cavity in the Pu hemispheres was about
0.85" in diameter. Since both the Urchin and the Pu core thermally expanded due to the heat generated by
their alpha-particle emissions, the slightly smaller 0.8" diameter initiator (according to sources) "fit snugly"
inside the Pu core. Current nuclear devices utilize external neutron initiation, which allows the plutonium
core to be machined shapes such as a sphere, cylinder, or ovoid. The dimensions specified in the Visgin
document for the Urchin initiator are as follows:
Radius of the hollow beryllium sphere 1.0 cm (0.39")
Radius of the base of the wedge-shaped groove 0.40 cm (0.157")
Radius of the top of the wedge-shaped groove 0.609 cm (0.24")
Radius of the solid beryllium ball 0.40 cm (0.156")
However, one source disputed the Visgin description and told the author on 5/19/08, "The urchin is machined
from two beryllium hemispheres. The inside is hollowed out by boring steps of decreasing radius using a
series of end-mills. The result is what looks like a 'theater in the round,' with the circular steps cut in each
hemisphere. The beryllium is then flash-coated with Po-210 on the steps." Yet another source confirmed to
the author in 2015 the Visgin descriptions are accurate

* Fat Man Urchin (from JCM footnotes):
  - Core internal cavity diameter (for the initiator/urchin): 0.85"
  - Urchin outer diameter: 0.8"
  - Urchin fits "snugly" into Core after thermal expansion of both
  - Be hemispheres outer diameter: 0.83"
  - "two Beryllium hemispheres"
    * "inside hollowed out by boring steps of decreasing radius using a series of end-mills"
    * "result looks like a 'theater in the round,' with circular steps cut in each hemisphere"
    * "Beryllium is then flash-coated with Po-210 on the steps"
  - "I never saw the final design but if it had 'parallel' grooves they must have been like latitudes, the only way they could be machined to be parallel"

* JCM thinks FatMan Pu hemispheres were 3.62" in diameter
  - doesn't think that his includes a 0.0005" (0.0127mm) layer of nickle

* Urchin in USSR Copy Device
  - inside out: 
  ==> I think this is backwards, need to separate Po and Be, inner surfaces of Po can be in contact with gold separation from the Be
    * solid Beryllium sphere (1cm), plated with Polonium, and then Gold (0.1mm)
      - BE sphere radius: 4mm (diameter=8mm, 10mm after thermal expansion?)
    * hollow Beryllium sphere, inner grooves plated with Polonium, and then Gold (0.1mm)
      - "inner surface are wedge-shaped grooves"
      - "planes of all the grooves are parallel to one another"
      ==> how is this possible unless it's stepped
    * 15x "wedge-shaped grooves"
      - radius of base of wedge-shaped groove: 4mm
      - radius of apex of wedge-shaped groove: 6.09mm

[I think that the USSR guys used a cast Be sphere with grooves and the US used a BE sphere that used different sized/depth end mills.]
